                    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="12">CodeCademy</a>: This is the site where I wrote my first lines of code ever! We all have to start somewhere, and I started with HTML and CSS and yes, my first line that I ever wrote was indeed
                    <b>"HELLO WORLD"</b> as so many others! The iconic sentence had to be my starting point! In the meantime, I have completed several courses and I find myself going back to the site from time to time to exercise some more. Thanks a lot CodeCademy, you were a perfect start for me!

                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="13">Udemy</a>: One of those "learn via watching videos where people explain what they're doing" type of sites. Quite fun to keep yourself busy with when you don't know what to do but in contrary to CodeCademy, hasn't Udemy helped me all that much. They just don't provide the same possibilities! They don't give you exercises and the don't really motivate you to keep going and practice after the videos. Nevertheless, am I trying to learn
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="14">Python</a> on their platform.

                    <a href="https://skillvalue.com/en" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="15">SkillValue</a>: I stumbled upon this site by accident after watching
                    <em>The Enigma Code</em> with Benedict Cumberbatch. As fate had planned, half an hour later, I saw a link on Facebook "Can you break enigma?" As curious as I was, I went and visited the site immediately. I was met with a very interesting site. There were more than 100 challenges and competitions about various programming problems, one of them being break enigma. There were different challenges for student as there were for professionals. If you'd win a competition, they would send you beautiful prices. I went and tried to break it but sadly enough I was to noob and now the competition has ended. Maye Next time, I'll be able to compete with other students and win myself one of those prices!

                    <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/home#" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="16">DataCamp</a>: This site handles a lot of data analysis but to be able to complete courses, you have to know Python (seeing that Python is the most used language for data analysis and neural networking). I'll definitely spent some time on the site, once I'm better at Python.

                <p>The last link I would like to put in the spotlight, is a YouTube channel. It's this crazy ninja who can do some pretty amazing things with programming, none other than:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg" class="extra_links" target="blank" tabindex="17">TheNetNinja</a>. This dude is very creative in making his own websites and explains everything he does very clearly, so you'd understand his thinking process. Another bonus point is his British accent, always fun to hear! He has helped me a lot with making my own website (see the Portfolio tab) and I'll definitely keep on watching his tutorials (until I'm as good as he is of course)!</p>
