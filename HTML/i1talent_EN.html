            <h3 class="title">Disc Test:</h3>
            <p>The DISC test result put me in category
                <span class="emphasis">S: the steady person</span>. If I'm going to be honnest, I find such test utterly ridiculous and don't agree
                with them what so ever. You're truing to divide humans into groups that don't match? Sure, I have some trademarks
                of the steady person, but I also have trademarks of the other types and most of all, I can find myself in
                all of the types and also in none. And that goes for almost all of us. But hey, you know, maybe I'm wrong?
                Let's just see what the future brings right ;)</p>

            <h3 class="title">The movie: Patser</h3>
            <p>So we went to see the movie 'Patser' by
                <a class="links" href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_El_Arbi" target="blank" tabindex="14">Adil El Arbi</a> (couldn't find an English link, sorry!) in the Kinepolis of Gent. I normally don't expect
                much from the Dutch movie industy and with that tought in mind, I went to watch the movie with 0 expectations.
                I've got to say, I was surprised in the happy way! I really did not expect it to be this 'good'. Okay, sure,
                there were some scenes where he over did it in my opinion and as he had warned us that for many of the cast,
                it was their first acting performance ever, the acting wasn't always that great but overall I would give
                it a solid 7/10. I've seen better movies but also a lot worse!
                <br />You can find the trailer right here:

            <h3 class="title">Power Distance</h3>
            <p>As we were told, I made my task about the power distance in both Russia and Sweden. I made a statement that in
                countries with more power distance, you would earn more as a boss than as a normal employee. I did my research
                and found out that in Russia, a CEO earns about 2 340 244 &#8381; as an average salery. In Sweden, a CEO
                erans about 1 275 227 &#x6b;&#x72;. If we convert both of these currencies to the euro, we get in Russia
                an average of 33 059.16 &euro; and in Sweden an average of 126 720.22 &euro;. You can clearly see that my
                statement was wrong.

            <h3 tabindex="17">Week 1: The Startup</h3>
            <p class="text-right date year">12/3/2018 &ndash; 18/3/2018</p>
            <p>So, we decided to do a crowd-sourced battery charging app/service called
                <b>PowerUp&trade;</b>. The idea is to create a community where nobody ever has to have an empty electronic device.
                We plan to make charging up you electronics a piece of cake with charge points everywhere, a map to indicate
                the nearest charging point and so much more! The crowd-sourced chargin would be based upon people who can
                install a "plug" somwhere on the outside of their house. If they were to supply electricity to the people,
                they would get rawarded for it that it wouldn't be a 0-operation for them.
                <br /> At this point, I can't share much about our project seeing how everything is being worked out and we're
                only in the development stage. I'll keep tabs on how our project progresses but I can give you at least a
                sneakpeak of how our current (and certainly not finished) app logo looks like:
                <img src="../IMAGES/Crowd charged logo.png" alt="first app logo" class="img-responsice"> </p>
            <br />

            <h3 tabindex="18">Week 2 &amp; 3: Our value for society</h3>
            <p class="text-right date year">19/3/2018 &ndash; 1/4/2018</p>
            <p>We've been working hard on our project these last two weeks and we've made some pretty big changes. The first
                I want to talk about is the fact that we had a name change. I didn't like PowerUp and so I started a poll
                with a few other names as well and it seems like I'm not the ony one who wanted another name. Eventually
                we came to a agreement and we changed our name to
                <b>ChargeBy&trade;</b>. With a new name also came a new logo. I layed the foundations for it by sketching something
                and the group seemed to like it so we worked i out further. I'm really happy with how it turned out. Here's
                a preview:

                <br />
                <br />
                <h4>Company name:</h4>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/Company-Logo.png" alt="The company Name" class="img-responsive" tabindex="19">
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4>Slogan:</h4>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/Company-Slogan.png" alt="The company Slogan" class="img-responsive" tabindex="20">
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4>Company logo:</h4>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/App-Logo.png" alt="The ompany Logo" class="img-responsive chargeBy text-center" tabindex="21">
                <br />
                <br /> Now for out value to society: I think we all know how annoying it can get when your phone or your electric
                skateboard has ran out of battery. They always do at the exact wrong moments. Now you don't ever have to
                waorry about that anylonger. We think we can add a lot of value to society just by making sure their batteries
                stay topped off!
            </p>

            <h3 tabindex="22">The commercial</h3>
            <p class="text-right date year">2/4/2018 &ndash; 2/5/2018</p>
            <p>We really had a blast shooting our commercial and editing it all. I think it turned out ok for non-professional
                editors and camera crew. We tried to speak to the average person with a electronic device and I think we
                reached them!
                <br />If you want to watch our commercial, you can find a link right here:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB0Nd-j8xAo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" class="links" tabindex="23">The commercial</a>
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 tabindex="24">My value to the team</h3>
            <p>As you all know by now and as de disc test has pointed out, I'm the reliable kinda guy in the team. I make sure
                we do our tasks and we finish them but I also got the feeling that I was a dominant type. If i didn't make
                the first move, nobody else did. I got the idea for our logo, I worte te script, I edited along with someone
                else, .... Overall we eventually got to do our part so it all worked out in the end!</p>
