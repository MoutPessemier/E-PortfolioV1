                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="extra_links" target="blank">CodeCademy</a>: This is the site where I wrote y first lines of code ever!We all have to start somewhere
                    and I started with HTML and CSS an yes, my first line that I ever wrote was indeed
                    <b>"HELLO WORLD"</b> as so many others! The iconic scentence had to be my starting point! In the mean time,
                    I have completed a number of courses and I find myself going back to the site from time tot time to exercise
                    some more. Thanks a lot CodeCademy, you were a perfect start for me!
                </p>

                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" class="extra_links" target="blank">Udemy</a>: Another one of those "learn via watching videos where people explain what they're doing" type
                    of sites. Quite fun to keep yourself bussy when you don't know what to do but in contrary to CodeCademy,
                    hasn't Udemy helped me all that much. Thy just don't provide the same possibilities! They don't gie you
                    exercises and the don't really motivate you to keep going and practice after the videos. Nevertheless
                    am I trying to learn
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="extra_links" target="blank">Python</a> on their platform.

                    <a href="https://skillvalue.com/en" class="extra_links" target="blank">SkillValue</a>: I sumbled upon this site by accidet after watching
                    <em>The Enigma Code</em> with Benedict Cumberbatch. As fate had planned, half an hour later, I saw a link
                    on facebook "Can you break enigma ?" As curious as I was, I went and visited the site immediately. I
                    was met with a very interesting site. There were more than 100 challenges and competitions about variious
                    programming problems, one of them being break engima. There were different challenges for student as
                    there were for professionals. If you'd win a competition, they would send you beautyful prices.I went
                    and tried to break it but sadly enough I was to noob and now the competition has ended. Maye Next time,
                    I'll be able to compete with other students and win myself one of those prices!

                    <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/home#" class="extra_links" target="blank">DataCamp</a>: I don't know much about this site
                    <em>yet</em> seeing that I havn't found the time/courage to check it out yet, but it did look very interesting
                    and they had some very appealing courses. I'll be editing this once I've explored the site and found
                    their strengths and weaknesses!

                <p>The last link I would like to put in the spotlight, is a YouTube channel. It's this crazy ninja who can do
                    some pretty amazing things with programming, none other than:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg" class="extra_links" target="blank">TheNetNinja</a>. This dude is very creative in making his own websites and explains everything he does
                    very clearly so you'd understand his thinking process. Another bonus point is his Britisch accent, always
                    fun to hear! He has helped me a lot with making my own website (see the Portfolio tab) and I'll definitely
                    keep on watching his tutorials(unitl I'm as good as he is ofcourse)!</p>
