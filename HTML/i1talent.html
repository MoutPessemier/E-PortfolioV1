            <h3 class="title">Disc Test:</h3>
            <p>The DISC test result put me in category
                <span class="emphasis">S: the steady person</span>. If I'm going to be honnest, I find such test utterly ridiculous and don't agree
                with them what so ever. Sure, I have some trademarks of the steady person, but I also have trademarks of
                the other types and most of all, I can find myself in all of the types and also in none. But hey, you know,
                mybe I'm wrong? Let's just see what the future brings right ;)</p>

            <h3 class="title">The movie: Patser</h3>
            <p>So we went to see the movie 'Patser' by
                <a class="links" href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_El_Arbi" target="blank">Adil El Arbi</a> (couldn't find an English link, sorry!) in the Kinepolis of Gent. I normally don't expect
                much from the Dutch movie industy and with that tought in mind, I went to watch the movie with 0 expectations.
                I've got to say, I was surprised in the happy way! I really did not expect it to be this 'good'. Okay, sure,
                there were some scenes where he over did it in my opinion and as he had warned us that for many of the cast,
                it was their first acting performance ever, the acting wasn't always that great but overall I would give
                it a solid 7/10. I've seen better movies but also a lot worse!
                <br />You can find the trailer right here:

            <h3>Week 1: The Startup</h3>
            <p class="text-right date year">12/3/2018 &ndash; 18/3/2018</p>
            <p>So, we decided to do a crowd-sourced battery charging app/service called
                <b>PowerUp&trade;</b>. The idea is to create a community where nobody ever has to have an empty electronic device.
                We plan to make charging up you electronics a piece of cake with charge points everywhere, a map to indicate
                the nearest charging point and so much more!
                <br /> At this point, I can't share much about our project seeing how everything is being worked out and we're
                only in the development stage. I'll keep tabs on how our project progresses but I can give you at least a
                sneakpeak of how our current (and certainly not finished) app logo looks like:
                <img src="../IMAGES/Crowd charged logo.png" alt="first app lofo" class="img-responsice"> </p>

            <h3>Week 2 &amp; 3: Our value for society</h3>
            <p class="text-right date year">19/3/2018 &ndash; 1/4/2018</p>
            <p>We've been woring hard on our project htese last two weeks and we've made some pretty big changes. The first
                I want to talk about is the fact that we had a name change. I didn't like PowerUp and so I started a poll
                with a few other names as well and it seems like I'm not the ony one who wnted another name. Eventually we
                came to a agreement and we changed our name to
                <b>ChargeBy&trade;</b>. With a new name also came a new logo. I layed the foundations for it by sketching something
                and the group seemed to like it so we worked i out further. I'm really happy with how it turned out. Right
                now we're working out what it is and how exactly we want to add to society.
                <br />
                <br /> Preview of the logo:
