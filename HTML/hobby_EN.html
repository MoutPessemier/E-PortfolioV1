                    <h4 class="section-divider hobby">Sports</h4>
                </b> in general is one of my favourite hobbies. I've already tried many sports and each one of them were very
                fun to practice. Sadly though, I can't enjoy them very long seeing how my lower back prevents me from it.
                <span class="outdated">I've had a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylolysis" class="links" target="blank" tabindex="12">spondylolysis</a> (more on that in the info tab!).</span> Since my last visit to the hospital, I've gathered
                some new info. Turns out I never had a spondylolysis, but I have a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis" class="links" target="blank" tabindex="13">scoliosis</a> instead. The different doctors told me different things so even for me, it's very hard to follow
                but I can promise you that it's very frustrating for someone who likes sports so much, but hey maybe it'll
                ever get better, until then, we just keep on trying! Here are some sports that I've already tried and stuck
                the most with me:

                    <h4 class="section-divider hobby" tabindex="18">Music</h4>
                </b> is one of those things as well. I used to make music myself when playing the
                <a href="#guitar" class="hobby" tabindex="-55">guitar</a>. Later on, I picked up the ukulele as well but right now, I've somewhat quitted playing those
                instruments. The time I put into those was immense and now I'm tired of practising but from time to time
                I grab them and start jamming for a few days/weeks and at that moment I always think: "I should really pick
                them up again!" If I ever were to pick up a new instrument, I'd want to learn the piano/keyboard. The possibilities
                with that instument are amazing and you can make some really good music! This day and age I listen to a lot
                of music. The power that's inside the beat, the vocals the symphony is immense! Music is my world and I'll
                never get enough of it!</p>

                </b> The last group of hobbies that I want to highlight are of course the IT related hobbies. Since I was young,
                I've always had a fascination for computers and how everything worked. Right now, I' studying that exact
                something and I'm loving every second of it!</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I came in contact with floorball thanks to one of my best friends and school. We all had to choose a subject
                to teach our fellow students and he chose his sport of course. I liked it very much from the get-go and in
                comparison to my classmates, he told me that I was quite good for a beginner (some sort of talent). Shortly
                after, I joined the club where he played. TMD, The Mighty Devils! Because I was a beginner, I as put with
                the "Whites" and he was playing with the "Blacks". I trained for half a year in total and after 1 year I
                quitted. Not ragequitted, quitted because of my injury.
                <span class="outdated">The spondylolysis... (on L4 for the doctors who read this, and no not both sides)</span> It was my scoliosis
                apparently. That's where it all started. As I said before, I trained for about half a year max in little
                pieces. 2-3 trainings and then I had to stop for 2 weeks out of pain. I played about 4 matches out of 10,
                I went to watch them all and I swear it hurts to sit on the sideline whilst my team was battling to win!
                Eventually I quitted. I mean I payed money for nothing seeing how I couldn't even train after some time.
                I've tried multiple times to train on my own at home and tried to get back into the sport but after 10 minutes,
                I lay on the ground with so much pain, I couldn't. If I could restart now, I wouldn't. That might seem weird
                to you but at this age, to be a beginner, is hell. You're missing such a skill gap that it's almost impossible
                to make that up and you'd only be dragging your team down. I had a shot at the sport and I missed is sadly.
                I try to stay in touch with my former teammates and the sport by watching some of their games. Of course,
                I want to grab my own stick and jump onto the field when watching but I know I can't, so I just stay on the
                sideline and give criticism on how they could improve and what they should've done ;) (easier said than done
                of course!)

                <div class="caption text-center">Me in my younger years playing tennis!</div>
            </figure>
            <p>I started playing tennis because my parents forced me to go to a tennis camp. You've got to know that my brother
                and I hate going to camps and stuff. So, we weren't really happy when we heard the news but now? I thank
                them that they did sent us there. When we arrived, there was a group of friends who went there for quite
                some time already and some of them had reached the highest group being "Green". Because of our age, Robbe
                (my brother) and I were automatically put into the green group as well even though we had never played tennis
                before. Being the younglings that we were back then, we received a lot of mean looks due to jealous kids
                who wanted to be in green as well. Great start! We were hated and we hadn't even done anything yet. Over
                time we came into contact with that group. At first, they weren't nice, but soon, we both realised that we
                actually liked each other and thus, some friendship bonds were foraged! If you look now, one of those guys
                I met back then, is my best friend (Tom, you'll come across him quite a bit on this site)! Since that year
                forward, we went to each and every single camp until we were to old, not to play tennis but to joke around
                and have a good time. Yes, we could play okay if we wanted to, but we never went to the camp to try hard,
                we went there to have fun. The only downside to the camp was the fact that at the end, we had to play an
                interclub tournament. I'm very stressy and I was dying each and every time we had to leave to play. That's
                the reason I never tried to hard otherwise the could've asked me to join their competitive team! I like it
                as a hobby, nothing more. Eventually I quit due to my back again. Serving was so painful. This leads me to
                table tennis. A few years after my last tennis camp, I started playing, thinking that the movement was limited
                and thus I would be able to keep playing with my back. How wrong I was! Half a year later I had to quit due
                to the pain.

            </figure>
            <p>Where to start with this hobby? I think at my 4
                <sup>th</sup> . First time skiing ever, exciting! After 1 day, I immediately got hooked and I have been hooked
                ever since. That's why I try to go into the mountains every year! If have been on a slope before, you'll
                probably have seen some 3 - 4 year olds skiing, that was me! Now I'm a full-fledged skier. I think I have
                been skiing for about 10/11 years. When you're already practising a sport for so long, you sometimes want
                something new. That's when I started snowboarding. I don't remember much from my first time skiing and thus
                I can't describe it, but I remember my first time on the board very vividly. The first 3 days were absolute
                hell. You fall, fall, fall and oh wait, you FALL! My coccyx was screaming: "You fool! Stop with this ridiculous
                sport and stop hurting me!" but I didn't listen. I kept on trying and suddenly out of nowhere, it worked.
                Very strange but also very fun! I could come down a mountain without falling and oh boy, did I enjoy it!
                Right now, I like snowboarding even better than skiing. Probably because I'm still relatively new to it but
                it gives me such a rush! with my board I at least dare to take jumps, go into a half pipe and so much more
                which I didn't do with my skies. That's also a reason I got less of a kick from skiing. But don't get me
                wrong, I still like skiing and I won't give it up! If I had to pick my favourite part of skiing/snowboarding,
                it has to be going away from the slope and into thick layers of snow.
                <br />For the real snowboarders out there. I prefer a flexible board over a non-flexible. I know, less speed, but
                the jumps feel so much better and the unexpected blocks of ice hit you way less hard (again, I also have
                to take my lower back into account, can't just do what I want sadly). Also, as fastest guy of our family,
                I have to wait for the other ones from time to time so being a bit slower isn't all too bad. Recently, I've
                been taking my best friend
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tom.clarys.5" target="blank" class="links" tabindex="24">Tom</a>, with me! If I were you, I'd watch out and avoid us because we make every slope unsafe!</p>

            <p>Biceps, triceps, quadriceps, leg day, ... A lot of words related to fitness that you don't come across often
                in the normal life, but a lot in the life of a motivated fitnesser! Motivated or not, many don't know what
                they're talking about when taking these words in their mouths. Luckily, there are some exceptions (me!).
                Fitness was some kind of last resort sport that I practiced and also the last sport at this point. This takes
                me back of course to my
                <span class="outdated">spondylolysis</span> scoliosis. Believe it or not but working with those weights was less hurtful for my
                back than any other sport I've tried! Sadly, it also didn't last. After a year, suddenly something really
                started hurting really bad and I had to quit. I've had some fun times though. Me and my bestie
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tom.clarys.5" target="blank" class="links" tabindex="27">Tom</a> went almost daily, terrorizing the local BasicFit. Almost dying when doing my self-invented abs training
                (thinking back brings back those sweet and painful memories!). Ultimate goal: six pack of course! And for
                that, you had to train every day! If I could (and when I'll be able to) I'll definitely pick up the sport
                again to get back that heavenly body but right now, I'll have to settle with doing absurd long series of
                exercises at home. WE DO IT FOR THE ... GAINS!!!</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Ah, the wonderful instrument, the guitar. I've been playing for quite a while now. I started playing somewhere
                in 2006. Since then, I've had a lot of tutors. I started in a music school where I received 2 diplomas. After
                that, I took 2 &ndash; 3 years a private tutor. In-between those 2 periods, my uncle also taught me and we
                played together on family fests, which I didn't find enjoying at all (more on that later). If you add these
                up, I think I follow lessons for about 6 to 7 years. Eventually, I had no courage anymore to practise every
                day and go to those lessons every week and so I quitted going to those lessons. I never really played that
                fun songs, but I couldn't really bring anything in myself because I didn't listen to much music with dope
                guitar solos or a fun struck pattern in. Don't think that because I quitted lessons that I quitted guitar
                in general. I kept on playing only this time I did it at my own tempo at home. Eventually that that got reduced
                to a minimum as well.
                <br />I the picture, you see me with my electric guitar, but I've also got a "classic" one.
                <br /> To come back on that "I don't like to play for anyone other than myself", that's just because I'm actually
                a really shy and insecure person who always thinks that it's not good/not enough and I always stress over
                those little things.

                <br /> To spark my rhythmic self, I bought an ukulele. You know, a little guitar with 4 strings (no not the datatype!).
                and also
                <i>NO BANJO!</i>). It's a very funny instrument, perfect for those evening summers on a beach. The sun is setting,
                a campfire is burning, everyone is a bit tipsy, but the mood is very warm, love is in the air and you need
                that high pitch music to lift the spirits even higher.
                <br />
                <br />I've been thinking to pick up keyboard but seeing that I never learned how to read notes (I know how to read
                them, but I never learned it. I prefer playing with accords), I would have to learn that first, then start
                with keyboard and it just sounds like so much work that I can spent on other things!

            <p>Programming, webevelopment, networks, you name it, I find it interesting. I found it interesting since I was
                14 and thus, my choise of what to do when I grow up was quickly made. I wanted to program and look at me
                now, I'm writing my own site, doing exacly what I dreamed of. I enjoy what I do and I want to keep doing
                it for as long as possible. Later on, I'd like to work for Google and be part of their AI program or I'd
                like to start up my own company. I think the contraversy over the dangers of AI are a bit farfetched and
                it is typical for the human race to think negative over something new rather than positive. AI's could help
                is so much in the future and they are part of it, of that I'm sure! Another interesting branch is the cybersercurity.
                The encryption of and finding new methods to encrypt on one side but also the hacking part speak to me as
                well. Much to do, much to learn! The last fun aspect I want to highlight is the fact that my world will never
                be standig still. Whether it's something "good" (new way of writing, new and powerful language, ...) "bad"
                (new malware or other harmful programs) we can learn from everything and we move forward. You'll never be
                bored because there is something new every day. That's what keeps this so fresh and uniqe and that is what
                I like about it!
