                <p>A date that has nothing of intrest for most of you reading this. For me? It's the day I was born. I 'popped'
                    out around 8 o' clock (AM that is). Was she happy that was finally over. When they gave me a first glanse,
                    the immediate thought was: OMFG! Such a cutie!!!! Blue eyes, round cheecks and nice round bum! My parts
                    were as happy as they could've ever been. My brother? Well, he had someone to annoy from there on out
                    so I guess he was happy to :D!

                <p>Ah, 't is the time in which many things happen but we don't remember any of it. We learn to brabble and eventually
                    speak, we start to learn how to read, write, walk, run, bike(with sidewheels) and so much more!
                    <br />As said before, I don't remember much from that time. Luckily, a lot got recorded an we've made them
                    into our own DVD's with me and my brother as the stars!
                    <em>"Robbeke &amp; Moutje's adventures!"</em>. They're worth watching believe me! Whilst watching them, I
                    realized that Robbe and I didn't really got along all that well. I can assure you, now he's one of my
                    best buds!

                <p>The time we went to 'school' for the first time. Me and my fellow todlers, having a blast, (p)laying around,
                    and honing our everyday skills. I'm using quite a lot of '' and that's because it wasn't really school,
                    not as we know it now at least. Even though I don't remember much, it still was a fundamental part of
                    our lives. Our first real contact with other children from BOTH genders! The classes were relatively
                    small and the whole 'school' know eachother.

                <p>Primary school. You remember about 2 articles ago hen I was talking about learning how te read and write?
                    Well this is were we all did it! The real deal. I don't know about the other schools but our school worked
                    with a niveau of reading and writing and you had to reach a certain level in a specific grade.I remember
                    that I was extremely happy when I finally reached level 9!
                    <br />Here again, love wasn't really real. (At a certain point I had 12 girlfriends at the same time, they
                    knew and ddn't mind, that's how real it was!) The biggest thing was making friends for "life". How naive
                    we were to think we would never lose eachother. In 6
                    <sup>th</sup> grade we had these 'big tests' to prepare ourselves for secondary school and let me tell you,
                    I bossed em!
                    <br /> Overall a fun time!

                <p>WATCH OUT! We belong to the big boys now! That how we felt at the end of the 6
                    <sup>th</sup> grade of primary school. Then you enter secondary school and suddeny realise that you are the
                    smalles, the youngest again. 6 years of survival, fighting the teachers because they sent way to much
                    tests our way, fight the bullies, fight your friends when they prank you, ... (with fight, I don't mean
                    litteraly hit someone!) to realize in the 6
                    <sup>th</sup> year that the teachers aren't always the bad ones and that all by all, it wasn't as hard as
                    you remember it was. I've got to say, I was really tired of secondary school quite quickly. Normally
                    it's something you start to hear around the 5
                    <sup>th</sup> grade but I already wanted to quit around the 2
                    <sup>nd</sup> one. I don't know why but I didn't like secondary at all. All these strict rules, no freedom,
                    you had to listen to whatever the teacher had to say and you were clearly underneath the. They had the
                    power and weren't always respectful. Also a heartbreak has played a big part in there as well (and yes
                    this time it was actually love!). I was happy when I graduated. Onto the next part in life!

                <p>Here we are. The today. I was stocked to start this year. New school, new friends, courses that actually
                    interest me instead of e.g. religion in secondary school. I hated going to school but now? I don't want
                    to miss a lecture! I enjoy it way better. Goofing around with the boys, studieng somthing I actually
                    enjoy, the freedom!
