# E-portfolio

INFO:
This site is made as a project for iTalent. A course you have to follow @HoGent.
It's made so they can check my progress and get a general idea of who I am.
This site is for public use, you can copy anything but if you see something new and exciting, please do mention the source a.k.a. me :)

PRACTICAL:
Everything is hand made (with the use of the Bootstrap 4 framework).
You can find my original concepts in the designs.
